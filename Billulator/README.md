## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My school and finals ended really late on Dec, 24th
Well, I had many issues. My mom didn't allow me to get a apple computer because of price. So I asked her if I could buy one and then return it for this opportunity temporarily (I am close to saving up) so I got it on Dec 29th at night because family friends HAD to come over while this assignment was still ongoing(unfortunately).
So the biggest challenge after getting the Macbook air was FileVault and it a really long time to "set up your mac". I closed my computer and the process apparently corrupted so I had to format the entire computer. My internet speed at home is really slow, and updating and reinstalling OS took 8 hours. I finally finished downloading OS and setting up when I woke up. I then had to download XCode and understand assignment on PreWork Assignment. I have a little C++ experience(1st semester of C++ exp) so I had some hope of understanding swift. I watched the 1 hour video on apple's website and then read through the documentation. I watched some breakdowns of swift on youtube. OOJ stuff was hard to understand as my school didn't touch upon that yet. I thought of some algorithms, looked at tip calculators. I had an image in my mind but nothing ever goes according to plan.

More Troubles:
dragging the little visual objects into the editor was a hassle and manytimes when you delete an object, the object remains. The open remaining object like always stood in my way of building and running. It ran but it crashes.
Git was hard to use initially as well with the repository thingy being confusing at first. I learned if the files on the server and your computer aren't the same, you can't push files which stopped me from sending from Universitypath helpers some questions for like a hour.
For some reason the Slider keeps on not working (changing values when I open a label) But I put the same code into a new project, it works perfectly.
Also Initially I tried making the keypad manually all by myself... then I realized I could change the textfield's keyboard manually without code... kinda cool.'
Future improvements: fix the decimal places on the percentage display
