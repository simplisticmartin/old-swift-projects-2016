# Project 4/5 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.
- [X] Profile page:
- [X] Contains the user header view
- [X] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [X] Compose Page: User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
- [ ] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.
- [ ] When composing, you should have a countdown in the upper right for the tweet limit.
- [ ] After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- [ ] Profile Page
- [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
- [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
- [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
- [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
- [ ] Tap account to switch to
- [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
- [ ] Swipe to delete an account

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

I had some help with a twitter template (if I had followed the tutorial all the way through i would've never been done') I spent over 20 hours on this implementing week 5. I have been told to work on week 5 then week 4... how is that even possible....???
